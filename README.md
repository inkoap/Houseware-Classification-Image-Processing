# Houseware Classification - Image Processing

In the Houseware Classification project, my main focus was to develop an intelligent and efficient solution for recognizing and categorizing household items based on their visual images. Through a combination of image processing techniques and machine learning, my goal was to create a system that could accurately and quickly identify various types of household items, enabling applications in various contexts, including inventory management, online retailing, and various other purposes.

I began the project by collecting and organizing a representative dataset using web scraping, which contained a variety of images of household items such as plates and spoons.

I divided the dataset into training and testing subsets and trained a classification model. Once the dataset was ready, I implemented image processing algorithms, such as feature extraction using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). CNN was a powerful choice due to its ability to recognize complex visual patterns. This process allowed the system to identify important characteristics of each type of household item, such as shape, color, and other specific features. In addition to CNN, I also used Naive Bayes and KNN algorithms by extracting features from the images before training.

During this phase, the model "learned" from the training dataset by recognizing patterns and relationships between images and their categories. After the training process was complete, I conducted a comprehensive evaluation of the model using a previously unseen testing dataset. The CNN model performed the best with an accuracy rate of 87.23%, the Naive Bayes model had an accuracy rate of 58%, and the KNN model had an accuracy rate of 76%.
